I included a pages document just describing everything I did to plan, as well as links to my wireframes, style guides, and trello boards.

Q1—Project Planning:

For my fonts, I decided to use somethingI found google fonts for free, called “Cinzel”. My website for this project is representing a law firm, so I wanted to have something powerful and professional, which I felt this represented well.

For my color scheme, I used several warm colors that I was able to generate on coolors.com. Their hex codes are #220901, #621708, #941B0C, #BC3908, and #F6AA1C. They are all orange-ish, yellowish, reddish, and burgundy, which is a good way to invite in users because they are not too dull or too bright but can keep someone’s attention and intrigue them.

The running theme throughout the site is to show prospective clients a law firm that could possibly represent themselves or their family members. I tried to make each page similar in terms of using parallax backgrounds for a nice, relaxing experience. Each page has the same navigation bar so that users can go back to the homepage or navigate around the page, read about the business, read about the attorneys, read from clients, or skip directly to a form where they can sign up.

Each page essentially starts out with a welcoming heading, the parallax images, content in the middle, another parallax image, a bit more content, then the footer at the bottom, reminding users of the contact information in case they don’t remember to scroll back to the top.

Style Guide:

	this does happen to be the one that was included in the gschool-106 project planning 			guide, but the black, reds and yellows are literally perfect for the company logo and my 			theme of warm, inviting southwestern colors.

WireFrames:

I made these three wireframes with wireframe pro. I made three different wireframes because apart from my landing page and my form with user input, all the pages of my site follow a very similar template with a page heading/title/greeting at the top, then primary content, then parallax background images, some secondary content; all pages have the same navigation bar and footer.
